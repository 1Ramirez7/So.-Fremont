# So Fremont car

This is a draft version for the So fremont car wash & laundromat website.


The process of setting the website live with squarespace is quite the process.

first I need remove squarespace default dns settings and then set the DNS on squarespace to point to githubs ip address and use my github profile in the cname.

I will then have to add the cname to my github custom domain settings 'sofremont1carwash.com' and that should do it.
